That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll.\r\n   For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for\r\n   which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have\r\n   the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and\r\n   it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we\r\n   are interested in.

For each\r\n   group, the 5 samples are mixed together and a single test is performed.\r\n   Then,\r\n\r\n     • If the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to\r\n       be virus-free.\r\n     • If the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a\r\n       separate test for each animal) to determine the affected\r\n       individual(s).\r\n\r\n   Since the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02,\r\n   the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:\r\n\r\n     • Negative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.98^5 =\r\n       0.9039207968.\r\n     • Positive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968\r\n       = 0.0960792032.\r\n\r\n   Thus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 × 5\r\n   = 1.480396016.\r\n   Consequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only\r\n   1.480396016 × 5 = 7.40198008 tests, which represents a huge saving of more\r\n   than 70% !\r\n\r\n   Although the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it\r\n   can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is\r\n   sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by\r\n   mixing different samples).
